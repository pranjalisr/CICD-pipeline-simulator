CI/CD Pipeline Simulator
This is a simple simulator I built to help visualize how CI/CD pipelines work. If you've ever been confused about continuous integration/deployment or wanted to see it in action before diving into the real thing, you're in the right place.

What's this all about?
I got tired of explaining CI/CD concepts using diagrams, so I made this interactive simulator using React and Next.js. It shows you exactly how a pipeline progresses through different stages, complete with realistic timings and state changes.

Next.js (because, why not?)
React (hooks are awesome)
TypeScript (saved my butt with type checking)
Shadcn/ui (for that sweet, sweet UI)
Lucide Icons (clean icons FTW)
